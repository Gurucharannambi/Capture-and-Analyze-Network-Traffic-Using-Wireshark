#Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark

## Objective
To capture live network traffic and analyze basic protocols using Wireshark.

## Tool Used
- Wireshark (Free)

## Procedure
1. Installed Wireshark from the official website.
2. Started packet capture on active Wi-Fi interface.
3. Generated traffic by browsing websites and using ping command.
4. Stopped capture after one minute.
5. Applied display filters such as dns, tcp, and icmp.
6. Observed packet details including IP addresses and protocols.
7. Saved the captured packets as a .pcap file.

## Protocols Identified
- TCP
- DNS
- ICMP
- TLS (HTTPS)

## Findings
- DNS packets were observed during website access.
- TCP packets showed reliable data transmission.
- ICMP packets were observed during ping operations.
- Secure web traffic was identified using TLS.

## Deliverables
- network_traffic_capture.pcap
- Screenshots of packet capture and filters

## Outcome
This task improved understanding of network packet analysis and protocol behavior.
